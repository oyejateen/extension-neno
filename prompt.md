hey there, I am participating in a hackathon by google' chrome build in ai(gemini neno). we have build a chrome extension integrating google's gemini neno. so, here's what we are building:

you know when user goes to a website and that website asks user for cookies, privacy policy and tos. so, what we do is automatically read the privacy policy, tos and cookies requirement and summaries all the complicated information to the user and also list the important critical point that user should know. 

Please, help me build it step by step. First made a mermaid diagram of this project, next create a file structure for the whole project. next lock those file and prevent from creating any other of those. 

i want to create this project in reactvite + tailwind so make sure to setup both and keep the backend in the nodejs. use gemini neno for the model.
